> I've only developed this on Mac OS X - so this only apples to Mac - One day I'll have a look at Windows

# background

The MOXF uses 5 MIDI ports in total. Of these ports

* Port 1 is used for MIDI notes and SysEx and Bulk Dump
* Port 4 is used for VST Editor

This Max external will utilise both of these ports to achieve its objectives.
